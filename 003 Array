Problem statement
You are given an array ‘Arr’ consisting of ‘N’ distinct integers and a positive integer ‘K’. 
Find out Kth smallest and Kth largest element of the array. It is guaranteed that K is not 
greater than the size of the array.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
vector<int> kthSmallLarge(vector<int> &arr, int n, int k){
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  vector<int> ans = {arr[k-1], arr[n-k]};
  return ans;
}
